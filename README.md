# Bikesharing

# Overview
The purpose of the assignment is to visualize the NYC bike share data and see possible trends in trip duration, gender usage, and frequency of usage per location. We were able to see clear patterns in when users liked to bike, popular duration of biking, and the distribution of types of users (subscribers vs regular users). By having this data, we can better predict where to build bikeshare racks and distringuish when the bikes need to be repaired.

![Checkout by Gender](https://github.com/limaggieling/Bikesharing/blob/main/Checkout%20by%20Gender.png)
## The above two visualizations show the number of bikes checked out and the duration at which they are checked out in minutes breaken down by gender

## The pie chart shows the percentage breakdown of gender

![Trips per Weekday by Hour](https://github.com/limaggieling/Bikesharing/blob/main/Trips%20per%20Weekday%20by%20Houor.png)
The heatmap shows trip per weekday by hour. From the coloration, we can see that the darker the rectangle, the more popular of a ride time it is for riders

![Trips by Weekday per Hour by Gender](https://github.com/limaggieling/Bikesharing/blob/main/Trips%20by%20Weekday%20per%20Hour%20by%20Gender.png)
we see that the same pattern of popularity holds for both men and women

![Trips by Gender Usertype per Weekday](https://github.com/limaggieling/Bikesharing/blob/main/Trips%20by%20Gender%20Usertype%20per%20Weekday.png)
Here we see that there are more subscribers than users and that since more men are riders, they are the majority subscriber

The above images show the dashboards of both general information that is telling of when repairs should take place as well as the demographics of our riders
